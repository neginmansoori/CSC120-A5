- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?

 I don't understand how composition gets set up in code. For instance, the engine can exist independantly ... I wonder whether each engine should keep track of the train to which it belongs ..?
 Aggregation is more clear in the way it is set up, examples including the engine and its fuel types, or the train and the passengers on board. The method of boarding/unboarding the passenegrs is based on the car methods, which links their methods. 
 I think I need more practice to understand how associations help with organizing and structuring the code. The instructions were really clear, and because of that this project was easy to follow.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The process of working on this project demonstrated that going to TA hours and working is effective. Although there might not be enough to seek TA's feedback, collaborating with other students and exhchanging methods gives insight into other perspectives. I worked with Joan during the TA hours.
